# ak-schools-and-community-maps
The Alaska Schools and Community Maps Project is a multi-page Dash web-app that uses Plotly Express and Mapbox to visualize community and educational data from large regions across the state of Alaska supported with graphs, charts, and statistical analyses.
For the Alaska Schools and Community Maps Project, I selected several large community and education data sets sourced from different state government agencies on the State of Alaska Open Data Geoportal and imported them into a database management system where I cleaned and standardized these large data sets using SQL. I used Plotly Express to create line and bar charts to supplement two interactive map web-apps that visualized relevant geographical data, and I used R statistical software to create frequency distributions to compare graduation rates categorized by various geographical community attributes. Furthermore, I conducted non-parametric hypothesis tests with this data using R to investigate correlations between four-year high school graduation rates and the aforementioned community attributes such as road connection, environmental threats, and Essential Air Service Program participation in rural Alaskan communities. This project and analysis are on the project website link.
