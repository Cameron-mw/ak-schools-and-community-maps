Permafrost degradation","Napakiak is subject to erosion, flooding, land subsidence due to permafrost degradation and severe weather.  Erosion of the Kuskokwim River bank is Napakiak's most imminent threat. Erosion been on-going since the 1960s and has been forecast by the US Army Corps of Engineers to be 25-50 feet per year. 2018 trip reports by the Natural Resources conservation Service and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium indicate that erosion rates had increased after spring break-up. The community has been actively pursuing the relocation of infrastructure, public buildings, residences and fish camps since the mid-1990s. Community members recently moved the threatened armory building."

Riverine erosion","Emmonak is impacted by flooding, erosion and severe winter storm events. Emmonak is located on Kwiguk Pass, which is a vast tributary to the Yukon River. For years, the riverbank has continually eroded away after each spring thaw as debris, ice, and excess water continue to pound the shoreline. The community has previously placed rip rap to secure areas of the riverbank, but erosion continues further upstream as the banks are left exposed to the elements. Infrastructure within 300 feet of the riverbank is threatened by this erosion. Flooding in Emmonak is widespread. Multiple areas within the village will flood simultaneously due to the low-lying terrain throughout the community. In 2013, Emmonak was part of the Presidentially-Declared Disaster (DR-4122) due to ice jam flooding."

The most active erosion area is at the 70-foot high bluff along 2,000 feet of the Koyukuk River adjacent to the village. Mass wasting has taken place along the bluff since 1974, particularly during spring break-up.  Community infrastructure (power plant, gas and oil bulk fuel storage facility, water and sewer pipes) and homes have been relocated to avoid erosion damage.  Single erosion events have been reported to cause as much as 80 feet of river bank to be lost along the 2,000-foot stretch adjacent to the village. In June 2014, high water in the Koyukuk River caused by heavy rainfall and snowmelt cause the loos of 70 feet of riverbank to erosion.  In early June 2019, high water in the Koyukuk River threatened homes and infrastructure along the eroding riverbank."

Severe weather","Shaktoolik experiences erosion, flooding and severe weather.  The community's location leaves it vulnerable to erosion when fall storms hit the sand and gravel spit where the village is located. There is no breakwater to protect the village from destructive waves from Norton Sound when storms come from the south. Considerable coastline erosion in the community occurred during recent storms in 2003, 2004, and 2005.   

Most of the Shaktoolik community and surrounding area lie within the 100-year floodplain. The village is extremely vulnerable to coastal sea storms. Erosion during flooding damaged the village airstrip so extensively it was replaced. In October 2011, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a coastal flooding analysis of Shaktoolik. The analysis indicated that in a 1% (or 100-year) flood event, the storm water level would overtop the entire community. There are no structures in the village with a finished flood elevation higher than the 100-year storm level."

Impacted by severe erosion since the 1980s, Newtok was advised that relocation would be more feasible than protecting-in-place over the long-term.  The community made the decision to relocate in the early 1990s and in 2003, after a lengthy negotiation process, Newtok Native Corporation completed a land exchange  with the federal government for land on the north side of Nelson Island known as Mertarvik.  The community has actively pursued relocation to Mertarvik since 2006.  In October 2109, approximately one-third of Newtok's current population will move permanently to Mertarvik, a major milestone in the village relocation effort.

Severe erosion has set in motion a range of adverse impacts to the community's safety and well-being.  Loss of the land buffer separating Newtok and the Ninglick River has made the village extremely vulnerable to storms moving in to the Ninglick River from the Bering Sea.  Flooding and storm surges have become much more frequent in recent years.  Erosion has claimed critical infrastructure such as Newtok's barge landing, boat docks and solid waste site.  Sediment from the eroding Ninglick River has infilled the one remaining point of water access to the community, subverting barge access  and impeding delivery of critical supplies, fuel and food. Newtok residents, particularly the very young and elderly, are experiencing significant public health problems because there is no proper way to handle human or solid waste. Erosion threatens the lake providing Newtok's potable water.  When this is lost, there will be a public health crisis in Newtok."

Permafrost degradation","Due to Bethel's location on the largest oxbow curve in the Kuskokwim River, the community is highly susceptible to riverine erosion.  The US Army Corps of Engineers built a seawall which has stabilized the Kuskokwim banks along the community and protects city dock and harbor infrastructure, residential and commercial buildings and the public road and utility poles nearby.  
Bethel experiences flooding nearly annually, inundating 80 % of the community's residential and commercial areas.    The USACE has determined that most of Bethel is within the Special Flood Hazard Area, areas where the ground elevation is below 17.1 feet mean lower low water. Areas such as Brown's Slough are the most flood prone and contain a high density of the residential development.  During breakup, flooding is caused by ice jams, however in late summer and early fall, heavy rains can also flood Bethel.  Poor drainage, frozen ground, permafrost, and low relief contribute to the flooding problems.  
The interaction of flooding and erosion have impacted community infrastructure in several events in 1985, 1990, 1995.  The impacts of degrading permafrost in Bethel include surface subsidence, impacting roads, buildings and residences, resulting in costly projects to repair damage."

One of the most remote communities in the United States, Diomede is located on the west coast of Little Diomede Island in the middle of the Bering Strait. The village has relied on shore-fast sea ice in the winter to provide a landing strip for planes transporting residents and delivering medicine and essential supplies. For generations, local hunters have relied upon sea ice to provide access to walrus, a main staple for Diomede families who depend largely on subsistence food from the ocean to survive. Recent changes in sea ice extent and weather patterns have severely decreased access to walrus and other subsistence resources, and limited air travel to helicopter service. A reduction in sea ice has made the village increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events.   Cyclonic and anti-cyclonic storms frequently create damaging ocean swells that batter the village.  These events have damaged local utility and power plants resulting in loss of power to homes, the school, and the store. Diomede has been part of disaster declarations due to severe weather in 1990 and 2004 and for utility failure (water, power) in 1991, 2003 and 2013."

Shishmaref's primary erosion hazards are wave and slough erosion, sea ice gouging, and slumping resulting from melting permafrost.  Erosion has undermined buildings and infrastructure, causing several structures to collapse and fall into the sea. Over the years, the community has tried many different techniques to arrest the erosion, including gabions, sandbags, and articulated concrete mats. All these efforts have provided only temporary solutions. Because the shoreline continues to recede, the community has moved houses and other structures back from the edge but has less and less space to do so.  According to the local hazard mitigation plan, the effects of climate change are expected to add to natural hazards including flooding in coastal areas. As sea level rises and the offshore ice pack retreats, more coastal flooding can be expected.

The community has experienced a number of severe coastal storms over the past 20 years that eroded the island to such an extent that the viability of the community is at risk. In October 1997, a severe storm eroded over 30 feet of the north shore, requiring 14 homes and the National Guard Armory to be relocated. Five additional homes were relocated in 2002. Other storms have continued to erode the shoreline an average of three to five feet per year on the north shore."
